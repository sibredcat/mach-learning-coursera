Hello Vladimir,

We're sending you this email to let you know that your roaming data has now been used for 100%. From now on, the standard rates will apply.

If you want to continue roaming at our Viking rates, please make sure to top up and purchase a new package. Donâ€™t forget you can also use your Viking Points to get calling credit!

Viking regards,

The Mobile Vikings Team
