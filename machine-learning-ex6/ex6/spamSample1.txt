Buyer,

I am pleased to use this medium to contact having
got your email address through my independent source, and i pray

this letter meets you well without any embarrassment as i want strictly a
neutral person, hence i wish to make quick offer to you regarding to the
gold bars we have for sale.

I represent a group of senior
politicians in the ruling National Democratic Party (NDC) Republic of Ghana
and due to security  reasons, i am mandated to source for a reputable buyer
to sell the gold to, which prompt my contacting you.  I would like to
inform you that you are not required to make any upfront payment for the
gold until after sales in your country.

Also, in view of the
caliber of politicians involved, all relevant documents that would enable
the shipment of the gold to your country will be legally and speedily
processed, and in meantime, the documents showing the origin and other
applicable documents are available for your perusal.

The
politicians want to sale the gold because of the upcoming general
elections, as they need money to do their campaign, so the price is $23,000
per 1KG and we have 2,500KG.

However, you will give me a
commission of 1% per 1KG.

The gold could be ship to you, if you
don't have time to visit Accra, Ghana.

Call me at +233
505040001 for further discussion.
